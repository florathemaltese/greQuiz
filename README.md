This project focuses on Web Development, covering both fundamental concepts and modern development practices for the web using JavaScript on both the front-end and back-end. The lessons learned are applicable to many languages.

Topics Covered:

Version Control:
Basic use of Git for version control in shared applications and development.

Web Application Flow:
How information flows in a web application between various machines.

Modern JavaScript Development:
Frontend development with "vanilla" JavaScript and React.
Backend development with Node.js, including server-generated content using the Express framework and service development.

Web Security:
Fundamental practices for web security on both front-end and back-end.

Development Team Practices:
Basics of how development teams break down application needs and complete work.

Section 1: Web Fundamentals
Topics:
HTTP, servers, web servers, browsers, clients, URL/URI, HTTP as stateless, request/response, headers/body.
The role of HTML, CSS, and JS.
Semantic HTML, MDN, browser wars, evergreen browsers.
HTML, CSS, and JS best practices.
Absolute vs relative paths/URLs.
Multiple-page web applications.
Static vs dynamic assets, client-side/server-side.
Programming languages as communication, idioms, static/dynamic languages, weak/strong typing.
JavaScript syntax, NodeJS, npm/yarn, package.json, global vs local installs, JSON.
Debugging JS, unit tests, testing pyramid, TDD.
Functions as objects, prototypes, 'this' (context), callbacks, threads, try/catch, closures, scopes.
Templates, Model-View-Controller (MVC).
HTTPS/SSL, public-key encryption, certificates, authentication, authorization.
Password hashing/salting, JWT, SQL Injection.
Cookies, localStorage, indexedDB.
Application state, state in model vs state in DOM.
At the end of Section 1, you should be able to write a simple multiple-page web application using NodeJS that serves semantic HTML and styles with CSS.

Section 2: Web Frontend
Topics:
The DOM.
JS-based validation.
Single Page Applications (SPA) and client rendering.
REST and JS-based service calls.
Asynchronous events (async), Promises, XHR/fetch/AJAX, HTTP verbs (methods), REST, services/endpoints.
Application state management, CRUD.
Same Origin Policy (SOP), CORS.
Polyfills, minifiers, linters, bundlers, transpilers, CSS preprocessors, builds.
At the end of Section 2, you should be able to write a simple SPA using vanilla JS that can call RESTful external services.

Section 3: The Recent Web
Topics:
Progressive enhancement.
Frontend frameworks/libraries, React, virtual DOM, JSX, SPAs.
Props vs state, pure components vs stateful components.
Agile, change management, software patterns.
Mockups, wireframes, prototypes.
Obfuscation, copyrights, and module licensing.
At the end of Section 3, you should be able to write a simple SPA using React JS.
